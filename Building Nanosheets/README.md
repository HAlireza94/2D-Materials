# Descriptions  
FCC(111):  
* Using this code, we can generate a sheet consisted of LJ atoms by following an FCC pattern while considering its face (111). Outputs of this code are written in two different file formats, .xyz and .gro, from which we can visualize the sheet and see if PBC is obyed or not.


XY sheet based on FCC:  
* This is a code aiming to make a sheet on XY plane using FCC concept. Since we want an XY plane, Z components are zero. The atom name is adjustable and the output is FCC.xyz.
