# Wetting Properties of 2D Materials  
In this Project, I investigated wetting properties of MXenes, Graphene, and Graphite.
First, contact angles are calculated using different approaches, including modeling  
using a cylinderical droplet, a semi spherical droplet. This helped me to understand  
the theory behind wetting properties that are based on free energies associated with  
interfaces (e.g., Liquid - Vapr, Liquid - Solid, and Vapor - Solid).  
I also studied SWIPES approach using PLUMED.
