# Wetting Properties of 2D Materials  
In this Project,wetting properties of MXenes, Graphene, and Graphite have been investigated.  
First, contact angles are calculated using different approaches, including modeling  
using a cylindrical droplet, and a spherical droplet. This helped to understand  
the theory behind wetting properties that are based on free energies associated with  
interfaces (e.g., Liquid - Vapor, Liquid - Solid, and Vapor - Solid).  
I also studied SWIPES approach using PLUMED.  
All these molecular dynamics simulations have been done using GROMACS, Packmol, ASE package in Python.
