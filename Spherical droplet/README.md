# Spherical Droplets  
This is an ongoing script on which I am working. Technically, I am calculating the  
density profile of the water droplet using cylindrical coordinate meshing. In doing so,  
"initial" and "box.inp" are used to generate a simulation setup on which we an start doing our  
molecular dynamics simulation. Then, I need to have coordinates of the center of mass for the   
water droplet that can be calculated by "run" and "COM.py". The output is "results". The only  
thing that has to be done on that is to average.
