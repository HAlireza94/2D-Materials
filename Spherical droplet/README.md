# Spherical Droplets  
This is an ongoing script on which I am working. Technically, I am calculating the  
density profile of the water droplet using cylindrical coordinate meshing. In doing so,  
I need to have coordinates of center of mass for the water droplet that can be calculated by  
"run" and "COM.py". The output is "results" which the only thing that has to be done on that is to  
average.
